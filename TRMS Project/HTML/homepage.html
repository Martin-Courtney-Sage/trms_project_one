  <h1 style="text-align: center">Welcome to TRMS</h1>
    
  <h2 style="text-align: center">A Place to Make your Tuition Reimbursement Request</h2>
    
  <br><br><br><br>

  <p id="main">
    TRMS is here for your tuition reimbursement needs. Our employee benefits team has organized a way for
    employees to grow their knowledge without the monetary stress that comes along with it. TRMS, or the Tuition
    Reimbursement Management System, is a system that will allow employees to create a request for reimbursement
    in University Courses, Seminars, Certification Preparation Classes, Certifications, Technical Training, and more.
    With this new system, employees will be able to submit a reimbursement request for approval up the chain of command,
    and be elegiable for a percentage of reimbursement for their chosen event.
  </p>

  <p id="main">
    Under your Employee Profile, employees will have the option to create/modify/delete their reimbursement form.
    Each of these forms will require your employee information, event description/cost, the grading scale/format
    for the event, and any additional documents that may be needed. Before obtaining reimbursement, this form
    must be submitted at least one week prior to the start of the event. After the event has concluded, the
    employee will be required to upload their grade report to the reimbursement form in the 'Documents' section
    as an attachment. After the required information/documentation is submitted, the form will be send to the
    Direct Supervisor for approval, followed by the Department Head, and finally BenCo (Benefits Coordinator).
    Approval from all three levels of command will be required to receive reimbursement.
  </p>

  <p id="main">
    *The approval process will start when the employee submits the reimbursement form before the start of the
    event. Then continue when the employee adds their grade report. BenCo might require additional actions/documentation
    depending on the type of event, which will be done during this process. Once everything is completed, BenCo will
    reward the employee with their designated reimbursement funds that were outlined in the approval guidelines.
  </p>
    
  <p id="main">
    **Each employee has a reimbursement amount of $1000 available to them each calendar year, but cannot tap into
    this amount unless a reimbursement form has been submitted and aproved.
